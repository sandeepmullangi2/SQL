A satellite television provider XYZ is looking forward to your help in retrieving some critical information from its data warehouse. The satellite television provider provides television channels bundled in packages to its subscribers.
The below diagram explains the key data tables and the relation-ship between them:
[Don't have diag]
D_SUBSCRIBER is a dimension table that has details of subscribers (customers).
D_PACKAGES is a dimension table that has details of various package offered by the provider
F_SUBSCRIPTIONS is a fact table that stores package subscriptions by each subscriber. A subscriber can have multiple records in this table during his lifetime
Please note the following business rules
• There are 2 types of packages. BASE pack and ADDON pack (which is mentioned in PACKAGE_TYPE attribute)
• Subscriber will have at least 1 BASE pack. They can have 0 or more ADDON packs
• A package is considered active for a subscriber if PACKAGE_SUB_END_DT in F_SUBSCRIPTIONS is NULL. Otherwise the package is not active for the subscriber
• A subscriber is considered to be active if there is a BASE pack linked to him with NULL PACKAGE_SUB_END_DT. Otherwise the subscriber is considered to be inactive.
• Each package has a PRICE_PER_DAY which is the fee for the package for a single day usage. A subscriber’s monthly fee is the PRICE_PER_DAY of each of his active packages multiplied by No. of active days in that month that he has been on that package. The fee is considered as revenue to the business.
Please find below sample data for each tables for better understanding
