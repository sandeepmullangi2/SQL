ORDER_ID PRODUCT_ID QUANTITY
odr1 prd1 5
odr2 prd2 1
odr3 prd3 3


output:

ORDER_ID PRODUCT_ID Qty
odr1 prd1 1
odr1 prd1 1
odr1 prd1 1
odr1 prd1 1
odr1 prd1 1
odr2 prd2 1
odr3 prd3 1
odr3 prd3 1
odr3 prd3 1

answer:
create table usersdb.dbo.test3 (order_id int, product_id varchar(10), quantity int)
insert into usersdb.dbo.test3 values (1,'prd1',5)
insert into usersdb.dbo.test3 values (2,'prd2',1)
insert into usersdb.dbo.test3 values (3,'prd3',3)

WITH CTE(order_id, product_id,quantity,startnum) AS(
  SELECT order_id,product_id,quantity,1 startnum
  FROM usersdb.dbo.test3
  UNION ALL
  SELECT order_id,product_id,quantity,(startnum + 1) as startnum
  FROM CTE
  WHERE (startnum + 1) <= quantity
)
SELECT order_id ,product_id,quantity,startnum
FROM CTE
order by order_id

2)
Group Sequence
A 2    
A 1    
A 3   
A 5   
A 6    
A 7   
B 10   
B 11   
B 13   
B 14   
B 15   


Group MinSeq MaxSeq
------------------------
A 1 3
A 5 7
B 10 11
B 13 15

answer:

with `a.b` as 
(
    select 'A' as group1, 1 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'A' as group1, 2 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'A' as group1, 3 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'A' as group1, 5 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'A' as group1, 6 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'A' as group1, 7 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'B' as group1, 10 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'B' as group1, 11 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'B' as group1, 13 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'B' as group1, 14 as sequence
    union all 
    select 'B' as group1, 15 as sequence

),
cte1 as (
select group1, sequence, sequence - row_number() over (partition by group1 order by Sequence) rn_s
from `a.b`
)
select group1, min(sequence),max(sequence)
from cte1
group by group1,rn_s




3)permutation of the given string or not
s1="driving"
s2="drivign"

def if_str_is_permuation(str1,str2):
    if len(s1) == len(s2):
        for char in str2:
            if char in str1:
                   continue
            else:
                   return false
        for char in str1:
            if char in str2:
                  continue
            else:
                return False
        return True
    else:
        return False
